        Welcome to the intersection of healthcare and technology! I'm Ariane
        Aoki Rubin, a passionate Healthcare web developer with a background in
        Dietetics. Equipped with dual master's degrees in Sports Medicine and
        Maternal and Children Nutrition from Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP),

        Allergy through FARE North America.

        I am a Brazilian immigrant, now residing in the USA, much like many of
        you. I'm accompanied by my three beautiful daughters - 13-year-old
        Giovana, 3-year-old Olivia, and 8-month-old Sophia, along with my
        husband, two dogs and a cat. They've been my constant companions,
        witnessing my transition into healthcare web development.

      <p style="width: 100%; color: black">
        I'm fueled by the opportunity to bridge the gap between healthcare and
        cutting-edge technology. My goal is to enhance patient care, streamline
        processes, and empower healthcare professionals through innovative web
        development and software solutions. Join me as we navigate the
        constantly evolving landscape of healthcare technology, shaping a
        brighter and healthier future for all.
