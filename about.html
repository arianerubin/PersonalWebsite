            Welcome to the intersection of healthcare and technology! I'm Ariane
            Aoki Rubin, a passionate Healthcare web developer with a background
            in Dietetics. Equipped with dual master's degrees in Sports Medicine
            and Maternal and Children Nutrition from Universidade de Sao Paulo
            (USP), I've further refined my expertise by specializing in
            Pediatric Food Allergy through FARE North America.

          <p style="width: 100%; color: black">
            I am a Brazilian immigrant, now residing in the USA, much like many
            of you. I'm accompanied by my three beautiful daughters -
            13-year-old Giovana, 3-year-old Olivia, and 8-month-old Sophia,
            along with my husband, two dogs and a cat. They've been my constant
            companions, witnessing my transition into healthcare web
            development.
          </p>

          <p style="width: 100%; color: black">
            I'm fueled by the opportunity to bridge the gap between healthcare
            and cutting-edge technology. My goal is to enhance patient care,
            streamline processes, and empower healthcare professionals through
            innovative web development and software solutions. Join me as we
            navigate the constantly evolving landscape of healthcare technology,
