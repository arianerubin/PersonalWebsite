            My first project was a quiz I made in Python. It's like those
            quizzes you see on BuzzFeed. But instead of fun stuff, it asks civic
            questions. There are 100 questions, and for each question, you pick
            from three answers. The quiz asks you 10 random questions. You can
            get a maximum of 4 answers wrong to pass. After each question, it
            tells you your score. You need to get at least 6 questions right to
            pass. If you get 5 questions wrong, you fail. At the end, it shows
            your name and your score.
