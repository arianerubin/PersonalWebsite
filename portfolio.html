          My first project was a quiz I made in Python. It's like those quizzes
          you see on BuzzFeed. But instead of fun stuff, it asks civic
          questions. There are 100 questions, and for each question, you pick
          from three answers. The quiz asks you 10 random questions. You can get
          a maximum of 4 answers wrong to pass. After each question, it tells
          you your score. You need to get at least 6 questions right to pass. If
          you get 5 questions wrong, you fail. At the end, it shows your name
          and your score.
