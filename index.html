        As a healthcare software engineer, my job is to create and put into
        action new solutions for the changing needs of the healthcare industry.
        Using my tech skills and knowledge of how healthcare works, I make
        software that helps hospitals and clinics run smoother, improve patient
        care, and make things more efficient overall. I look closely at the
        problems healthcare workers face and use my coding abilities to make
        custom solutions. Whether it's building electronic health record
        systems, setting up telemedicine tools, or coming up with AI programs
        for diagnosis, I'm working to push healthcare tech forward. My main goal
        is to make sure the software I create is accurate, safe, and easy to
        use, helping to make healthcare better for everyone.
